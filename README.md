## Welcome! 

---

This repository documents the **step-by-step path** I‚Äôm following to master ML, starting from foundations to advanced concepts.

---

## üìç Goals

* Build a **strong foundation** in programming.
* Understand the **theory and intuition** behind ML algorithms.
* Gain **hands-on experience** by building projects.
* Master **real-world applications** of ML and AI.

---

##  How I'll proceed-

### **1. Foundations (Pre-requisites)**

*  Python basics (data types, loops, functions, OOP)
*  Data handling with `NumPy`, `Pandas`
*  Data visualization (`Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`)
*  Basic C



---

### **2. Core Machine Learning**

* Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Ensemble)
* Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, PCA, Clustering)
* Model Evaluation (Bias-Variance, Cross Validation, Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)

**Resources:**

* [Andrew Ng‚Äôs ML Course (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning))
* [campusx(youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH)

---


### **3. Real-World ML & Tools**

* Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
* Working with Large Datasets
* ML Pipelines & Deployment (MLflow, Docker, FastAPI)
* Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

---

### **4. Projects (Hands-On)**

* toy project - Predict rain (logistic Regression)
* and more
